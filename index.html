      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Forex ATS is an automated trading system for the foreign exchange market. To keep it on the cutting edge,
        we run regular competitions where developers submit improved versions of the algorithm. The best entry becomes the new master strategy and wins the prize.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Register for the next competition.</li>
        <li>Improve the current trading algorithm by adding features or optimisations.</li>
        <li>Submit your version for evaluation in a live trading environment.</li>
        <li>The version with the best performance wins and becomes the new master strategy.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Cash prizes are funded by an optional copy‑trading service that replicates the master algorithm across user accounts. As performance improves and more users join, the prize pool grows for the next round.
