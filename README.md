# Forex ATS Competition Platform

## Inspiration
Forex ATS is an automated trading system for the foreign exchange market. We wanted to transform algorithm development into a game where the community competes to improve the bot, and everyone benefits.

## How It Works
- Participants register for competitions where they submit improved versions of the trading algorithm.
- A copy‑trading service optionally replicates the master algorithm across users’ accounts. The service fee funds the cash prizes.
- When a competitor wins with a better algorithm, their version becomes the new master strategy. As performance improves, more users join and profits grow, increasing the next prize pool.
- Each competition introduces updated rules that encourage innovation and risk management, ensuring the system stays cutting‑edge and robust.

## Benefits
- **Sustainable funding:** prize pools come from copy‑trading fees rather than external sponsors.
- **Continuous improvement:** every winning entry strengthens the algorithm and improves returns for all users.
- **Growing community:** better performance attracts more copy traders, enlarging the next prize pool and creating a virtuous cycle.
- **Open competition:** anyone can compete and contribute new ideas, so the system evolves with diverse insights.
